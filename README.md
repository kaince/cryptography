# Resources for a First-Year College Mathematical Cryptography Course
Resources for a unit or course in cryptography without prerequisites from a number-theoretic perspective.

To access Jupyter notebooks (made for students to learn how to write basic SageMath/Python code for basic ciphers), see [Python Modules](https://github.com/kaince/cryptography/tree/main/Python%20Modules).
